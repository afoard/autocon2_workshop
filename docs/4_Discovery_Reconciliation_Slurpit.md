### Slurpit - Importing our devices from the network

**Discovering our Network with Slurpit**

Tools that are used to import operational state from our network into Netbox are typically called **Discovery** tools. Network Discovery typically falls into two categories:

1. Network discovery - Scans a list of IPs or subnets to find any network devices in the network
2. Device discovery - Logs into specific devices to extract their configurations

[Slurp'it](https://slurpit.io/) is a fully featured discovery tool. As the website says "If there’s a `show` command we can slurp’it!" Slurp'it can do network and device discovery across a large selection of network devices.

Let's slurp our network devices into Slurp'it using network discovery.

```
echo ${MY_EXTERNAL_IP}:${SLURPIT_PORT}
(Example output, yours will differ)
147.75.34.179:8000
```

Navigate to `Adminstrator` -> `Device Finder` and you'll see our device finder which has already been configured for you. Click on `Start` in the top right, and Slurpit will discover the devices in our network.

Now navigate to `Devices` and you'll see our lab devices. Click on the ellipsis menu (three dots) on the far right side of each device and click `Schedule Now`.

Slurp'it will take a short while to discover information about our devices. Then you can view the discovered information by clicking on the new tab icon on each device, and navigating to the `Collected data` tab.

Feel free to explore the data Slurp'it has discovered about our devices. For example, under the `Interfaces` tab we can see the following:

**Importing the discovered network from Slurp'it into NetBox**

### Connect Slurpit to NetBox

- Log in to NetBox and navigate to `SLURP'IT` -> `Settings`
  - Under `Data synchronization` choose BOTH and click `Save`
  - Under `Slurp'it server` click `Edit`
    - Enter your Slurp'it URL
    - Enter the Slurp'it API token: `1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxqz`
    - Click `Save`
  - Go to `Data tabs` and under `Planning` click `Sync`
    - You'll now see a populated list of the all the data Slurp'it can reconcile into NetBox
    - Select `All` and then click `Save`

Now that Slurp'it has discovered our network, we need to import it into NetBox. The Slurp'it team have built a plugin for NetBox to help users intuitively reconcile the data in Slurp'it into NetBox, so let's dive in.

First navigate to your NetBox instance.

```
echo ${MY_EXTERNAL_IP}:${NETBOX_PORT}
(Example output, yours will differ)
147.75.34.179:8001
```

In the NetBox left-hand menu click on `SLURP'IT` -> `Onboard devices`

If you now click `Sync` the Slurp'it plugin will pull the devices it has discovered about our network over to NetBox.

Now select both `clab-autocon2-srl1` and `clab-autocon2-srl2` click on `+ Onboard`. You'll see the Slurp'it device onboarding screen.

- Under `Management Interface*` enter `mgmt0`
- Under `Site*` select the `Denver` site that was pre-populated in NetBox
- Click `Apply`

Now the devices in our network have been successfully imported into NetBox! You can confirm this by returning to the NetBox homepage and navigating to `Devices` -> `Devices`

Pulling discovered network data into Netbox happens in two stages in Slurp'it. The step, which we just did, is to onboard the devices. The second step is to `Reconcile` the additional data about the devices into NetBox.

> Slurp'it automatically pushes new data to be reconciled to NetBox every minute, but if you don't want to wait run this script

In the NetBox left-hand menu click on `SLURP'IT` -> `Reconcile`

<img src="images/slurpit/plugin_menu.png" alt="Slurpit Plugin Menu" title="Slurpit Plugin Menu" width="300" />

Select the `IPAM` tab, select all the IPs and then click `Accept`.

Select the `Interfaces` tab, select all the interfaces and then click `Accept`

<img src="images/slurpit/reconcile_interfaces.png" alt="Slurpit Reconcile Devices" title="Slurpit Reconcile Devices" width="750" />

Now the device interfaces have been added to the devices in NetBox. To confirm, navigate to `Devices` -> `Devices` -> `clab-autocon2-srl1` and select the `Interfaces` tab.
