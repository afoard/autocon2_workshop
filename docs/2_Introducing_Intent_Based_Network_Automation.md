**Section 2 - Introducing Intent Based Network Automation**

- Network - N/A

- Show the reference architecture. Many automation tutorials focus on the right of the diagram, but as we’ll see if you only focus there you can find yourself in the situation of accelerating an already bad process
- Explain the high level concepts - Understanding each of the tools isn’t difficult, understanding how they all fit together is. That’s what we’re doing today
- Fire them up for some learning, we’re going to learn by doing

**Proctor Summary**

- Show that despite much investment, many are still struggling with network automation
- Introduce the reference architecture as a way to explain intent based network automation and why that is the eventual pattern that may successful organizations arrive at
- Introduce the flow for the rest of the workshop TL;DR “rather than getting bogged down in terminology, we’re going to learn by building”

Much has been written about network automation and Intent Based Networking, so rather than adding to that, we're going to learn by doing. In the next sections we will introduce various modern tools and techniques make sure that changing our networks is less painful.
