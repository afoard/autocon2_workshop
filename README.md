# Installation

## Set environment variables

To function correctly we need to tell the services which ports to run on and which fqdn is being used to access them. This script sets all the necessary variables, to change the behaviour you can edit it.

```
./0_set_envvars.sh
```

## Docker and ContainerLab

```
./1_install_docker_and_clab.sh
```

## Install and start Slurpit

> [!NOTE]
> You need to set the Slurpit version (COMMIT_HASH) and Slurpit portal URL (PORTAL_BASE_URL)

```
COMMIT_HASH="3e2d20458e46cc026d39fde599f01f2a615a2e25" PORTAL_BASE_URL="http://147.28.133.73:8000/" ./2_start_slurpit.sh
```

Now you should be able to log in to Slurpit at `PORTAL_BASE_URL`

```
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: 12345678
```

## Start the ContainerLab network

```
./3_start_network.sh
```

## Start NetBox

> [!NOTE]
> This can take a few minutes. Use `docker compose logs -f`to follow along

```
./4_start_netbox.sh
```

## Start Icinga

```
./5_start_icinga.sh
```

You should now be able to log into Icinga:

Username: icingaadmin
Password: icinga

## Start Netpicker

```
pushd netpicker
./6_start_netpicker.sh
popd
```

Now you should be able to log in to Netpicker at URL:8003
